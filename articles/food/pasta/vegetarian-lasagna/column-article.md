# Vegetable Lasagna

Ingredients:

- 250 g lasagna plate

Filling:

- 3 carrots
- 2 onions
- 1 red paprika (bell pepper)
- 1 tbsp honey
- 4 cloves of garlic
- 6 pcs sun-dried tomatoes
- 1 can tomato sauce
- 1 zucchini
- 1 a pot of basil
- 1 a pot of oregano
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- salt
- pepper

Cheese sauce:

- 50 g butter
- 1 dl wheat flour
- 6 dl vegetable broth
- 2 dl whipped cream
- 1 dl parmesan
- salt
- green pepper
- nutmeg
- 200 g grated mozzarella

Work steps:

1. Fry grated carrots, chopped onions and chopped paprika in a pan in
   olive oil. Let it soften. Add honey, crushed garlic, chopped
   sun-dried tomatoes and tomato paste. Leave to simmer for 5-10
   minutes. Finally, add chopped herbs and salt and pepper to taste.

2. Melt the butter in a saucepan. Don't let it brown. Add the flour
   and mix well. Add vegetable broth and cream, stirring
   constantly. Boil on low heat for a few minutes. Add grated
   mozzarella and half of the parmesan. Let the cheeses melt and mix
   well. Season and remove from the plate.

3. Grease the lasagna pan. Place the vegetable mixture on the bottom
   and slice a layer of zucchini slices on top (about half a
   centimeter slices). Pour cheese sauce on top and lay a layer of
   lasagna sheets on top. Repeat layer by layer until the top layer is
   left with lasagna sheets. Pour the rest of the cheese sauce over
   the plates so that the plates are covered.

4. Sprinkle the rest of the Parmesan on top. Bake at 200 degrees on
   the middle level of the oven for about 30 minutes. Remove the food
   from the oven and let it rest for about 15 minutes, covered with
   foil.
