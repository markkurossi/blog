# I Hate You, I Love You Go

This is the first post in a series of blog articles about my love (and
partly dislike) relationship with the [Go](https://golang.org)
programming language.  And just to set the record straight, I enjoy
programming with Go very much.  The hate/dislike part comes from some
surprise experiences when trying to use Go as systems programming
language where you actually care about memory management and CPU
cycles.
